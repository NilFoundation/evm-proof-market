# Proof Market Endpoint for Ethereum

## Introduction
This repository presents the Solidity smart contracts required to interact with the Proof Market.
The repository uses Hardhat as a development environment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

## Dependencies

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.0

## Compile
```
npx hardhat compile
```

## Test
```
npx hardhat test #Execute tests
```

## Deploy
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
```

To deploy to a local network, you can use the following command to start a local node:
```
npx hardhat node
```
And then deploy to the local network in a separate terminal:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Usage
TODO

## Events

To listen to events emitted by the smart contracts, you can use the following command:
```
npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/trackEvents.js
```

To generate some events, you can use the following command:
```
npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/interact.js
```
